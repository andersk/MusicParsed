[Verse 1]
F C Am G
You already write 
many songs,
lines and lines,
in Sublime because

[Chorus x2]
C G Am F
Each song is a module,
each verse is a function, and
Python’s your words.

[Verse 2]
F C Am G
So why not write
your own songs?
Lines and lines.
Just make them rhyme because

[Chorus x2]
C G Am F
A song’s just a module,
each verse just a function, and 
words are your code.

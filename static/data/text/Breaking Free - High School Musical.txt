[Zac] We're soaring, flying
          G#                       D#         
[Vanessa] There's not a star in heaven

that we can't reach
F
if we're trying 
G#
so we're breaking free

G#                  D#           A#     Cm
in a way that's different than who we are
[Vanessa]
                 F
creating space between us
       G#                   D#  A#
'till we're separate hearts

[Both]
G#
But your faith
F
it gives me strength
G#
strength to believe

like a wave the ocean just can't control
[Vanessa]
Cm                  F                 
connected by a feeling oooh 
         G#      D#   A#
in our very souls

Rising 'till it lifts us up

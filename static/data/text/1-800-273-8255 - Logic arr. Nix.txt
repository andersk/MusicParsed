[Pre-Chorus x2]
Bb C Dm F
I been on the low
I been taking my time
Bb C Dm F
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus]
DUx DUx DUDU
Dm Bbmaj7 Fadd9 Csus4
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today
I just wanna die
Dm Bbmaj7 Fadd9 Csus4
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1]
DDD UDU DD
Dm 
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
          Bbmaj7  
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
       Fadd9 
And my life don't even matter
                               Csus4
I know it I know it I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it
              Dm 
I never had a place to call my own
              Bbmaj7 
I never had a home
Ain't nobody callin' my phone
          Fadd9
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
               Csus4
They say every life is precious but nobody care about mine

[Pre-Chorus]
DUD DUD DUDU
Dm Bbmaj7 Fadd9 Csus4
I been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus]
DUx DUx DUDU
Dm Bbmaj7 Fadd9 Csus4
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today
You don't gotta die
Dm Bbmaj7 Fadd9 Csus4
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die
Now lemme tell you why

[Verse 2]
DUD DUD DUDU
F 
It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with the lover
Fsus4
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
F
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3]
DUD DUD DUDU
Dm Bbmaj7 Fadd9 Csus4
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
Dm Bbmaj7 Fadd9 Csus4
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus]
Single strums
Dm Bbmaj7 Fadd9 Csus4
I been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus]
DUx DUx DUDU
Dm Bbmaj7 Fadd9 Csus4
I finally wanna be alive 
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today
I don't wanna die
Dm Bbmaj7 Fadd9 Csus4
Finally wanna be alive 
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die

[Outro]
Bb C Dm F
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow

Dm Bbmaj7 Fadd9 Csus4
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Dm Bbmaj7 Fadd9 Csus4
Oh I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore
Bb C Dm F

[Burr]

G                    Bm/F#
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
Em
You have my eyes
Cmaj7
You have your mother's name
D         G                      Bm/F#
When you came into the world you cried
                Em
And it broke my heart

Cmaj7  D

G                  Bm/F#
I'm dedicating every day to you
Em                Cmaj7
Domestic life was never quite my style
D         G
When you smile
Bm/F#                    Em
You knock me out, I fall apart
                      Cmaj7   
And I thought I was so smart

D          G                        Bm/F#
You will come of age with our young nation
                Em
We'll bleed and fight for you
               Cmaj7        
We'll make it right for you
D      G                  Bm/F#
If we lay a strong enough foundation
              Em
We'll pass it on to you
                Cmaj7
We'll give the world to you
                   D    G
And you'll blow us all away
   Bm/F#    Em   Cmaj7
Someday, someday
                      D   G
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
   Bm/F#    Em   Cmaj7 D
Someday, someday


[Hamilton]

G   Bm/F#                      Em
Oh, Phillip when you smile I am undone
Dsus4   
My son
     D     G
Look at my son
Bm/F#                            Em
Pride is not the word I'm looking for
                 Dsus4          D
There is so much more inside me now
G   Bm/F#                         Em
Oh, Phillip you outshine the morning sun
  Dsus4  D
My son
         G      Bm/F#
When you smile
       Em
I fall apart
                      Dsus4  D
And I thought I was so smart

My father wasn't around (My father wasn't around)
                     D  C           D  C
I swear that I'll be around for you
                 D  C                           D  C
I'll do whatever it takes (I'll make a million mistakes)

We'll give the world to you
            D           G
And you'll blow us all away

Someday, someday

Someday, someday

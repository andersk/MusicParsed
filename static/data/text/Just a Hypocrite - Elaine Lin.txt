Gm                F
I tell my body promises every day
        Bb
I can't seem to keep them
Gm                  F
I see my flaws everywhere
                      Bb
I can't seem to leave them
   Gm7
So why
     F               Eb
do I tell you how to be?
             F
What I see reflects the (w)hole in me
   Gm7
So why
     F               Eb
do I tell you how to be?
                   F
All your flaws can find a place in me.
Gm7 F Eb F
Gm          Eb            Bb
I guess I'm just a hypocrite
Gm          Eb            Bb
I guess I'm just a hypocrite

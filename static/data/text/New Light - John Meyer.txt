[Intro]
Dm  G  C  F  F/E
Dm  G  C

[Verse 1]
Dm                  G
I'm the girl in your other phone
C                       F              F   F/E   Dm
Lighting up inside your drawer at home all alone
                  G
Pushing 20 in the friend zone
C                    F         F     F/E
We talk and then you walk away every day
Dm                  G
Oh, you don't think twice 'bout me
C                E7                     Dm
And maybe you're right to doubt me, but

[Chorus]
           G                      C
But if you give me just one night
             F           F   F/E  Dm
You're gonna see me in a new light
             G                     C
Yeah, if you give me just one night
            F              F   F/E
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Dm                G                   C
Oh, I want a take two, I want to breakthrough
                 F          F     F/E  Dm
I wanna know the real thing about you
         G                     C
So I can see you in a new light

[Verse 2]
Dm                G
Take a ride up to Malibu
C                    F            F       F/E
I just wanna stay to look at you, look at you
Dm                           G
What would it matter if your friends knew?
C                    F          F  F/E
Who cares what other people say anyway
Dm            G
Oh, we can go far from the end
C              E7                  Dm
And make a new world together baby

[Chorus]
              G                      C
'Cause if you give me just one night
             F           F     F/E  Dm
You're gonna see me in a new light
             G                      C
Yeah, if you give me just one night
            F              F   F/E
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Dm                G                   C
Oh, I want a take two, I want to breakthrough
                 F           F    F/E  Dm
I wanna know the real thing about you
         G                      C
So I can see you in a new light

[Bridge]
Dm  G  C  F
Dm  G  C

[Chorus]
Dm         G                      C
Ah, if you give me just one night
          F           F   F/E  Dm
You gonna see me in a new light
             G                      C
Yeah, if you give me just one night
            F              F   F/E
To meet you underneath the moonlight

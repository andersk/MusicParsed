[Verse 1]
G
hey i hear the voice of a preacher from the back room
C
calling my name and i follow just to find you
G                                       D
i  trace the faith to a broken down television and put on the weather
G
and i’ve trained myself to give up on the past
C
cause i frozen time between hearses and caskets
G
lost control when i panicked at the acid test
D
i wanna get better

[Verse 2]
G                                               C
while my friends were getting high and chasing girls down parkway lines i was losing my mind
G                                               D
cause the love, the love, the love, the love, the love that i gave wasted on a nice face
G                                       C                              G
in a blaze of fear i put a helmet on a helmet counting seconds through the night and got carried away

[Pre-Chorus]
                                D
so now I’m standing on the overpass screaming at the cars hey I wanna get better

[Chorus]
G                       C
i didn’t know i was lonely til i saw your face
G               D
i wanna get better
G                       C
i didn’t know i was broken til i wanted to change
G               D
i wanna get better

[Verse 3]
G
i go up to my room and there’s girls on the ceiling
C
cut out their pictures and i chase that feeling
G
of an eighteen year old, who didn’t know what loss was
D
now i’m a stranger
G
and i miss the days of a life still permanent
C                       G
mourn the years before i got carried away

[Pre-Chorus]
                                D
so now i’m staring at the interstate, screaming at myself hey i wanna get better

[Bridge]
G                       C
cause I’m sleeping in the back of a taxi
                        G
i’m screaming from my bedroom window
C
even if it’s gonna kill me

[Verse 4]
G
woke up this morning early before my family
C
from this dream where she was trying to show me
G                               D
how a life can move from the darkness, she said to get better
G                                               C                      G
so i put a bullet where i shoulda out a helmet and i crash my car cause i wanna get carried away
                                D
that’s why i’m standing on the overpass screaming at myself, hey, I WANNA GET BETTER

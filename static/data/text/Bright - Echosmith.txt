[Verse 1]

G
I think the universe is on my side
G
Heaven and Earth have finally aligned
C                 D                         G Gsus4 G
Days are good and that's the way it should be

G
You sprinkled star dust on my pillow case
G
It's like a moonbeam brushed across my face
C                   D                         G Gsus4 G
Nights are good and that's the way it should be


[Pre-Chorus]

                 Em             C
You make me sing oo-oo-oo, la la laaa
                   Em
You make a girl go oo-oo-oo
       C     D
I'm in love, love


[Chorus]

G                       Em        D
Did you see that shooting star tonight?
G                       Em          D
Were you dazzled by the same constellation?
G                      Em       D
Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me?
        C                    G              D
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
                       G       D  C
'Cause now I'm shining bright, so bright
G       D  C
Bright, so bright


[Verse 2]

G
And I see colors in a different way
G
You make what doesn't matter fade to grey
C                D                         G
Life is good and that's the way it should be


[Pre-Chorus]

              Em              C
You make sing oo-oo-oo,la la laaa
                   Em
You make a girl go oo-oo-oo
        C     D
I'm in love, love


[Chorus]

G                       Em        D
Did you see that shooting star tonight?
G                       Em          D
Were you dazzled by the same constellation?
G                      Em        D
Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me?
        C                    G              D
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
                       G                D  C
'Cause now I'm shining bright (oooohhh) so bright
          G            D       C
And I get lost (ooohh) in your eyes


[Chorus]

G                       Em        D
Did you see that shooting star tonight?
G                       Em          D
Were you dazzled by the same constellation?
G                      Em        D
Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me?
        C                    G              D
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
        C                    G              D
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
                       G       D  C
'Cause now I'm shining bright, so bright
G       D  C
Bright, so bright
G       D  C
Bright, so bright
          G       D    C
And I get lost in your eyes
G 
Tonight

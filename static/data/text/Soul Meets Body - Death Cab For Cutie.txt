[Verse]

Dm                   F
I want to live where soul meets body
Dm                       F
And let the sun wrap its arms around me
Dm                         F
And bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing
    C                              Dm
And feel, feel what its like to be new

                           F
Cause in my head there’s a greyhound station
Dm                          F
Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
Dm                           F
So they may have a chance of finding a place
              C
where they’re far more suited than here


[Chorus]

Dm   F            C
I do believe it’s true
               Dm            F           C
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
       Dm            F
If the silence takes you
       C
Then I hope it takes me too


   Dm           F        C
So brown eyes I hold you near
                 Dm          F       C
Cause you’re the only song I want to hear
       Dm       F       C
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere



Dm                  F
I cannot guess what we'll discover
Dm                        F
We turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
      Dm                       F
But I know our filthy hand can wash one another’s
    C
And not one speck will remain


[Chorus]

Dm   F            C
I do believe it’s true
               Dm            F           C
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
       Dm            F
If the silence takes you
       C
Then I hope it takes me too


[Instrumental]



[Bridge]

      Dm         Dm    F  Dm       Dm     
Where soul meets body                     
      Dm         Dm    F
Where soul meets body
C
Where soul meets body


[Chorus]

Dm   F            C
I do believe it’s true
               Dm            F           C
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
       Dm            F
If the silence takes you
       C
Then I hope it takes me too


   Dm           F        C
So brown eyes I hold you near
                 Dm          F       C
Cause you’re the only song I want to hear
      Dm        F       C
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere


[Outro]

      Dm        F       C
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere       
      Dm        F       C
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
      Dm        F       C
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

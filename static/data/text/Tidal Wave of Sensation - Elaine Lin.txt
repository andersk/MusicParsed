Am
Am I drowning? 
F
All I feel is a 
C                G
tidal wave of sensation
sweeping, pouring, crashing,
G5                           Am
aching, aching, aching in my brain
       F
Is it okay?
To feel this
C                G
tidal wave of sensation
                         Am
that's about to drown my brain
               F
until it's all pain.
       C                G
Just a tidal wave of sensation
                     Am F C G G5
I can't take another day.

Ooh ooh ooh-ooh.
